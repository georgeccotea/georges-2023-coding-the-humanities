DenialGiven any statement, we can form another by denying the first. The resulting denial is false or true according as the original statement is true or false. The denial of a statement will be written by putting the statement in question in the blank of '~(	)''; butthe parentheses will be suppressed unless the statement within them is a conjunction. Thus the denial of 'Kansas touches Iowa'' is:(1)	~ Kansas touches Iowa, and the denial of ยง3(1) is:(2)	~(Jones is ill. Smith is away).The tilde '~'' is a modified 'n'' and is conveniently read 'not''.The method of forming the denial in ordinary language is irregular. Sometimes 'not'' or 'does not'' or 'fails to'' is applied to the main verb; thus (1) might appear in words as 'Kansas does not touch Iowa'', or 'Kansas fails to touch Iowa''. If the statement has no one main verb, denial is accomplished by one or another periphrasis; e.g., the denial (2) might be rendered in words thus:(3)	It is not the case that Jones is ill and Smith is away.

    "The British singer Gary Numan is often regarded as a pioneer of electronic music, debuting as a solo artist in 1979 with [The Pleasure Principle](https://open.spotify.com/album/6wHjdKs7VVPVcqaHRzwqJt), an album that reached the top of the UK Albums Chart. The song \"Cars\" from this album became a worldwide hit. The album is notable for relying heavily on synthesizers, with no electric guitar, yet having a rock structure. Befitting of this futuristic-at-the-time sound, the lyrics cover science fiction themes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, Gary Numan has changed his style and sound several times, but he is still releasing albums which are well regarded and are considered to have a contemporary sound. It would be interesting to see how much an artist's lyrics change over such a long timespan of about 40 years. In this assignment, we will explore the lyrics of the 1979 album The Pleasure Principle and of his 2017 album, [Savage](https://open.spotify.com/album/2d98ICB4Uin8lszUnnCwxo), which again covers science fiction themes.\n",

you for forgiveness would you smile and wonder why would you say that you believed me or would it all fall down would it all fall down is it over is it over now if i said i was a liar would you lose your faith in me if i said i was mistaken would you share the blame with me if i said i was a memory would you still remember me if i said i was a warning would you shy away from me if i asked you for forgiveness would you turn your face away would you say i broke your heart and would it all fall down would it all fall down is it over is it over now when a new tear falls when i hear you cry softly i would give the world to change the past and when you walked away and i saw what i was losing only me to blame i wondered why why why so it all comes back to haunt me like a song that sings your name and it burns here to remind me that it all comes back as pain when i asked you for forgiveness and the words drifted away i watched them float in empty silence as it all fell down as it all fell down it was over it was over then'}\n"
